# Creatorverse Task Log

Facts only. GitHub issues and labels remain the workflow source of truth.

## 2026-07-19 — CV-MVP-005A automated usability proxy gate

**Outcome:** Add a deterministic engineering proxy for the creator-to-follower loop without presenting automation as human research. The current decision is `AUTOMATED_PROXY_PASS` on exact head `a4350de85c8246b8df0836865c8612c42bc1f140`.

### Completed

- Added five deterministic Playwright profiles covering Arabic RTL and English LTR, touch and keyboard, `320×568` and `390×844`, isolated browser storage, visible-control interaction, keyboard focus, minimum 44 px targets, overflow, accessibility, interaction budgets, screenshots, and the creator → invite → follower → role → route → mission → result/share → language-preservation loop.
- Added a fresh-session recovery profile for malformed invite, clipboard denial and retry, empty content, loading, recoverable mission-source failure, and recoverable service failure using synthetic fixtures only.
- Added exact-head JSON and Markdown evidence tied to the isolated Railway PR Preview URL, branch, `/health`, and `/version`, with regression tests for missing, stale, wrong-SHA, wrong-branch, Production, incomplete, and research-mislabeled evidence.
- Added the syntax gate and CI report-integrity check without adding a dependency, account, credential, analytics, Production data, recruitment, interview, survey, facilitator, or manual evidence requirement.
- Hardened the shared interaction token to `max(2.75rem, 44px)` so the creator close control and other token-based controls retain the required CSS-pixel floor in mobile browser profiles.
- Corrected the recovery helper so the controlled first clipboard denial is observed as a visible focused manual-copy state before the same named action succeeds on retry.

### Validation

- CI runs #164, #166, #167, #168, and #169 exposed and preserved factual syntax, locale-bootstrap, touch-target, exact-head identity, and recovery-helper failures; none was treated as passing evidence.
- CI run #171 on exact head `a4350de85c8246b8df0836865c8612c42bc1f140` passed locked `npm ci`, proxy syntax, unit tests, localization parity, production build, exact isolated Railway Preview selection, `/health`, `/version`, branch and commit identity, malformed-path safety, and post-request liveness.
- The same run passed all five automated profiles, the complete creator-to-follower core loop, Arabic/English and RTL/LTR paths, touch and keyboard operation, state preservation, interaction budgets, minimum target size, overflow checks, axe serious/critical gates, all six controlled recovery states, screenshot generation, and exact-head JSON/Markdown report integrity.
- Artifact `browser-quality-a4350de85c8246b8df0836865c8612c42bc1f140` is retained through 2026-08-02.
- `AUTOMATED_PROXY_PASS` is an engineering regression signal only. It is not evidence of human comprehension, demand, retention, preference, or market validation.
- Rollback is limited to reverting Pull Request #19; no database, secret, account, dependency, Production-data, or external-service rollback is required.

### Next best task

Run independent QA on the unchanged final PR head and exact Railway Preview; do not weaken the proxy, add product scope, or reinterpret automated evidence as human research.

## 2026-07-19 — CV-MVP-004 safe prototype invite handoff

**Outcome:** Connect creator onboarding completion to one safe copyable prototype invite and one fresh-session follower entry without real social actions, identity disclosure, or product-scope expansion.

### Completed

- Added a versioned fragment-only invite payload with strict field, theme, length, decoded-size, encoding, protocol, and credential bounds.
- Included only fictional realm name, allowlisted theme, and optional fictional promise; creator handles, contacts, secrets, query data, unknown fields, and external-account data are excluded.
- Rejected malformed encoding, duplicate invite parameters, bidi controls, explicit URLs, bare domains, external URI schemes, contact-like data, social handles, selected real-world political targeting, and hostility or mobilization wording before rendering.
- Added focused regression coverage for `example.com`, `discord.gg/room`, `ftp://example.com`, custom `scheme://` values, `mailto:`, unsafe realm names, and manually crafted unsafe invite tokens.
- Kept creator completion inside the existing studio and added one dominant copy action with idle, pending, success, denied or unsupported manual-copy, failure, retry, disabled, focus, and live-region states.
- Added a compact English LTR and Arabic RTL follower entry immediately before the unchanged role → route → result loop, while withholding Create and Creator tools until the invited follower completes the mission.
- Added a localized invalid-invite recovery path that does not echo the malformed payload and returns to the normal featured realm.
- Used existing design tokens, semantic elements, logical properties, a content-based breakpoint, 44 px action targets, mixed-direction isolation, and reduced-motion handling without a new dependency or framework migration.
- Added focused unit tests plus bilingual Playwright, axe, keyboard, fresh-context, copy-denial, invalid-recovery, 200% text-zoom, overflow, reduced-motion, and screenshot coverage at 320×568, 390×844, 768×1024, 1024×768, and 1440×900.
- Five-user usability sessions were not conducted or claimed in this implementation cycle.

### Validation

- CI run #150 on head `b685b394d30249e4d5a72120de335a7c3a13db85` passed locked installation, unit/localization/build gates, and exact isolated Railway Preview `/health`, `/version`, branch, commit, malformed-path, and post-request identity checks.
- Run #150 browser evidence exposed an Arabic-only localization mutation loop when the invite-owned dynamic realm values were repeatedly translated and restored; no release stage was advanced on that head.
- The focused repair prevents the generic Arabic localizer from rewriting invite-owned localized components and follower realm values, preserving dynamic text and stopping the microtask loop without weakening tests.
- CI run #152 on implementation head `733a29151cc4fc688d638852aa8a94c77f2e6b3e` passed locked `npm ci`, `npm run check`, the production build, exact isolated Railway Preview verification, the complete English/Arabic browser matrix, axe, keyboard flow, fresh-session invite entry, invalid recovery, 200% text zoom, and responsive screenshot gates.
- A P2 review on earlier head `314c4d8a5c` identified that bare domains and non-HTTP external schemes could bypass the original external-text denylist.
- CI run #155 on focused repair head `68dd06f139267bcc1287b7d5d6cc1e119d65943e` passed locked installation, the expanded unit and localization gates, `npm run check`, production build, exact isolated Railway Preview `/health` and `/version`, branch and commit identity, malformed-path safety, post-request liveness, bilingual Playwright, axe, keyboard, text zoom, responsive evidence, and artifact upload.
- Browser evidence artifact `browser-quality-68dd06f139267bcc1287b7d5d6cc1e119d65943e` is retained through 2026-08-01; the safety repair changed validation only and preserved the approved visual, responsive, Arabic/English, state, and interaction behavior.
- Rollback is limited to reverting Pull Request #15; no database, dependency, secret, account, environment, or external-service rollback is required.

### Next best task

Run independent QA on the unchanged final PR head and exact Railway Preview; do not add persistence, authentication, social posting, analytics, rewards, or another feature to this cycle.

## 2026-07-19 — CV-QUALITY-003 responsive cascade precedence

**Outcome:** Make the existing mobile text-pressure rules authoritative without changing product copy, layout identity, or release checks.

### Completed

- Confirmed the release blocker was CSS cascade precedence: `src/quality-responsive.css` loads before later equal-specificity base declarations from `src/styles.css`.
- Added narrowly scoped `body` component prefixes only to the existing `max-width: 30rem` safeguards so role, mission, realm, result, and navigation reflow rules outrank later base rules without `!important`, hidden overflow, font reduction, forced breaking, or duplicated media blocks.
- Preserved semantic order, natural role-label wrapping, keyboard focus, 44×44 targets, Arabic RTL and English LTR composition, reduced motion, result states, safety acknowledgement, and share/copy safeguards.
- Added `test/quality-responsive.test.js` to lock the focused specificity contract and reject hidden-overflow or ellipsis shortcuts.
- Added no product-facing string, dependency, integration, persistence, secret, schema, Railway change, or visual redesign.

### Validation

- CI run #145 on implementation head `319e90b1c53014fcb65d59c3de4410d199b53d8b` passed locked `npm ci`, unit tests, localization parity, Railway verifier tests, and the production build.
- The same run passed exact isolated Railway Preview `/health`, `/version`, branch and commit identity, malformed-path safety, and post-request liveness without using Production or shared Staging as Preview.
- Playwright and axe passed the required English and Arabic role-ready/result-ready matrix at 320×568, 390×844, 768×1024, 1024×768, and 1440×900, including 200% text zoom, page and essential-label overflow assertions, keyboard order, focus visibility, 44×44 targets, state preservation, controlled share failure/retry/success, live regions, and reduced motion.
- Browser evidence artifact `browser-quality-319e90b1c53014fcb65d59c3de4410d199b53d8b` is retained for 14 days.
- Rollback is limited to reverting commits `5e52071c69a9bd3a9a8af20fb8ec189a9e39d0cd` and `319e90b1c53014fcb65d59c3de4410d199b53d8b`; no data, dependency, environment, or secret rollback is required.

### Next best task

Run independent QA on the unchanged final PR head; do not add product scope or relax the responsive gate.

## 2026-07-18 — CV-QUALITY-002 mobile text-zoom overflow repair

**Outcome:** Preserve the mobile role-first hierarchy while allowing English and Arabic content to reflow without horizontal scrolling or broken words at 200% text zoom.

### Work completed

- Expanded Playwright coverage from viewport-only zoom captures to full-page role-ready and result-ready screenshots for English and Arabic at 320×568 and 390×844.
- Added explicit checks for all three role choices, keyboard focus visibility, 44×44 touch targets, result facts, the result action, natural word boundaries, and element-level inline overflow at 200% text zoom.
- Added adaptive wrapping for role choices, mission routes, realm statistics, and result facts without clipping, page-level overflow hiding, transforms, font reduction, or new product copy.
- Preserved role order, original SVG icons, selected states, Arabic RTL composition, English LTR composition, reduced motion, safety behavior, and the existing isolated Railway Preview verifier.
- Added no dependency, persistence, integration, secret, schema, production mutation, or product-scope expansion.
### Validation

- CI run #137 passed the previous gate, but artifact inspection showed that its viewport-only 200% screenshots did not prove the role choices and rendered result facts with character-level wrapping.
- CI run #139 on head `82e6ce2472de5cac15173cef712f772c7c6583fa` passed locked build and exact isolated Railway Preview checks; browser quality failed because the first natural-wrapping assertion was too brittle and the evidence still showed narrow split role labels.
- CI run #141 on head `041124122778ae9ea7eda44c50895f12b35338d6` passed locked build and exact isolated Railway Preview checks; browser quality reproduced page overflow of 62 px and 39 px in English, 10 px in Arabic at 320×568, and Arabic role-label inline overflow at 390×844.
- CI run #142 on head `a84a133c542b1456c21ca37d29d8d1009374d0ac` again passed locked build, `/health`, `/version`, malformed-path safety, and post-request identity on the exact PR environment, but browser quality reproduced the same zoom failures.
- Source-order review established that `src/quality-responsive.css` is linked before `src/main.js` imports `src/styles.css`; equal-specificity mobile declarations such as `.role-grid` therefore lose to the later base rules. The remaining fix is a narrow cascade-order or selector-specificity repair, not a reason to weaken the browser gate.
- Three focused repair attempts were exhausted. The branch remains preserved, the issue remains `stage:build`, and the cycle is marked `ci:blocked` with artifact `browser-quality-a84a133c542b1456c21ca37d29d8d1009374d0ac` retained for 14 days.
- Rollback is limited to reverting commits `e7a236fd2f10e3c058b2877ae9f44af200e5c082`, `82e6ce2472de5cac15173cef712f772c7c6583fa`, `787d53052e6bf5ea6ced98a38ecb7f0bb955bd95`, `041124122778ae9ea7eda44c50895f12b35338d6`, and `a84a133c542b1456c21ca37d29d8d1009374d0ac`; no data or dependency rollback is required.

### Next best task

Preserve PR #10 and split or explicitly authorize one narrow cascade-order repair; do not add a feature or move the issue to release until the exact-head browser gate passes.

## 2026-07-18 — CV-QUALITY-001 repository quality pipeline

**Outcome:** Make pull requests reproducibly installable and independently verifiable through real browser, accessibility, localization, and exact isolated Railway Preview gates.

### Completed

- Added and committed `package-lock.json`; CI build and browser jobs use `npm ci` on Node 22.12.
- Added Playwright Chromium checks at 320×568, 390×844, 768×1024, 1024×768, and 1440×900 in English LTR and Arabic RTL.
- Added exactly 20 baseline viewport screenshots: role-ready and result-ready for both locales at all five required sizes.
- Added width-and-height 44 px target checks, keyboard focus-visible checks, horizontal-overflow checks, 200% root-text-zoom checks, reduced-motion validation, result fact/live-region checks, controlled Web Share loading/failure/retry/success checks, and clipboard fallback checks using synthetic browser fixtures only.
- Added axe checks for role-ready, completed-result, language-switch, controlled action error/success, and creator safety-error states in both locales.
- Preserved the selected role and completed result through an intentional language reload by restoring bounded session-only interaction state; no account, external post, or durable product data was added.
- Added mission-result Arabic/English key parity and visible-copy bypass checks.
- Moved Railway Preview selection into a tested Node verifier that accepts only HTTPS isolated PR-environment domains for the current PR and rejects shared Staging, Production, wrong branches, empty or wrong SHAs, and arbitrary Railway hosts.
- Reused the same verifier after the malformed-path probe so post-request `/health` and `/version` cannot pass with missing commit metadata or a switched candidate.
- Documented permanent Production, Staging, and PR Environment roles and clarified non-overlapping workflow ownership.
- Corrected `ROADMAP.md` and `BACKLOG.md` to record the completed share-result prototype and prepared usability protocol without claiming the five sessions were conducted.

### Validation

- GitHub CI runs #120, #123, #125, and #126 passed locked installation, unit/localization/build gates, and exact isolated Railway Preview identity, `/health`, `/version`, malformed-path, and post-request checks.
- Run #125 generated all 20 required role-ready/result-ready screenshots and passed the bilingual result, state-preservation, focus, target-size, controlled action, and axe paths except the English 200% text-zoom overflow gate.
- Run #126 preserved the passing pipeline work but left the isolated mobile text-zoom defect for focused cycle CV-QUALITY-002.

### Next best task

Use CV-QUALITY-002 evidence for release review; do not repeat or broaden the completed pipeline work.

## 2026-07-18 — CV-MVP-003 share-ready mission result

**Outcome:** Replace the plain mission-complete sentence with one compact, bilingual result receipt that explains the follower's contribution and exposes one safe share-or-copy action.

### Completed

- Added a semantic mission-result field receipt inside the existing playable area with selected role, selected route, `+3` energy, realm energy before/after, and the affected district.
- Added exactly one dominant action: native Web Share when available, otherwise a localized copy fallback.
- Built the share payload from bounded allowlisted result fields and a validated HTTP(S) public URL with query and fragment data removed.
- Added controlled pending, success, cancel, denial, clipboard failure, unsupported, invalid-URL, retry, and repeated-activation states.
- Added predictable focus on the result heading, separate one-time completion and action-status live regions, a 44 px minimum action target, isolated LTR values, and reduced-motion handling.
- Added synchronized English/Arabic result copy and intentional RTL composition without changing onboarding, imports, mission rules, persistence, or external integrations.
- Added responsive composition evidence and focused unit/design gates without adding a dependency or changing the vanilla Vite architecture.

### Validation

- `node --check` passed for `src/mission-result-i18n.js`, `src/mission-result.js`, and `src/mission-result-view.js`.
- Focused `node --test test/mission-result.test.js`: 4 tests passed.
- Source review confirmed intrinsic one-column phone layout, a content-based `40rem` breakpoint, 44 px action target, logical properties, mixed-direction isolation, and reduced-motion overrides.
- Full `npm run check`, GitHub CI, exact-head Railway Preview `/health` and `/version`, and browser screenshots at the required viewports remain required before release review.

### Next best task

Run independent QA on the exact PR head; do not add invitation, persistence, authentication, or another feature to this cycle.

## 2026-07-18 — Professional visual release repair

**Outcome:** Put the playable role-and-route loop first and replace the rejected generic landing-page presentation without changing the selected MVP behavior or safety model.

### Completed

- Removed the tall marketing hero, repeated principles section, generic orbit decoration, gradients, glows, pill controls, Unicode placeholder symbols, and repeated explanatory copy.
- Made role selection and the 35-second mission the first product content after navigation at phone widths.
- Added a product-specific signal-route map and custom inline SVG symbols for the brand, roles, themes, imports, and disclosure control.
- Moved YouTube profile and public-post imports behind one optional Creator tools disclosure while preserving loading, empty, error, success, and disabled states.
- Integrated the language control into navigation and raised language and primary interaction targets to the 44 px token.
- Added explicit Arabic RTL desktop grid composition, RTL action order, logical CSS properties, and isolated LTR URLs and numbers.
- Preserved the required fictional-world acknowledgement and its keyboard focus, localized error, `aria-invalid`, and launch-blocking behavior.
- Added `test/design-gate.test.js` and `docs/visual-evidence.md` with bilingual mobile visual evidence.

### Validation

- `node --check` passed for `src/main.js`, `src/profile-import.js`, `src/localize.js`, and `src/i18n.js`.
- Focused `node --test test/design-gate.test.js`: 3 tests passed.
- Headless Chromium passed English LTR and Arabic RTL at 320×568, 390×844, 768×1024, 1024×768, and 1440×900 with no horizontal overflow.
- The same browser run verified visible creator access, 44 px language targets, role-to-route interaction, mission success, localized safety blocking, focus recovery, and successful launch after acknowledgement.
- Full `npm run check`, GitHub CI, and the exact-head Railway Preview `/health` and `/version` checks remain required before release review.

### Next best task

Run QA against the final PR head after CI and Railway Preview complete; do not expand the current slice.

## 2026-07-18 — CV-MVP-002

- Added `docs/usability-test-plan.md`, a synchronized English/Arabic 10–15 minute five-user protocol and scorecard.
- Defined neutral facilitator wording, the single permitted recovery prompt, mobile/keyboard observations, controlled-state evidence, per-task pass criteria, and the `4 of 5` Milestone 0 decision rule.
- Included anonymized-ID, voluntary-consent, no-recording-by-default, minors, data-minimization, raw-note deletion, fictional-world, no-real-account, no-secret, and non-destructive-fixture safeguards.
- Added a dry-run checklist, per-participant scorecard, five-session summary, and repeated-friction/contradiction table.
- Changed documentation only; no application, deployment, workflow, secret, external API, or Railway configuration files were added or modified.
- `npm run check` and automated tests were not available on the documentation-only `main` base at that time; documentation structure and required-field checks were completed before commit.
- Five-user testing itself was not conducted or marked complete.

## 2026-07-18 — Focused Railway PR Preview trigger repair

**Outcome:** Ensure Railway's focused PR-environment detector treats the root Creatorverse service as affected by any repository change, so the isolated service can deploy and expose `/health` and `/version` instead of being skipped.

### Completed

- Added an explicit root-level Railway `build.watchPatterns` rule matching `**`.
- Kept the existing Railpack build, `npm start`, `/health`, timeout, and restart policy unchanged.
- Preserved the CI rule that rejects Production as Preview and requires the exact PR branch and commit.

### Validation

- GitHub CI run #64 already proved `npm run check`, tests, and the production build pass on the preceding application head.
- The final head must re-run the same checks and obtain a public isolated Railway PR deployment before the issue can move to release review.
- If Railway still reports the service as unaffected, the remaining blocker is the Railway service Root Directory or dashboard watch-path configuration, which is external to repository code.

### Next best task

Run QA only after the isolated Railway PR service returns HTTP 200 from `/health` and `/version.commitSha` matches the final PR head.

## 2026-07-18 — Static-path and Preview isolation release repair

**Outcome:** Prevent malformed request paths from crashing the Node server and ensure pre-merge verification cannot use the permanent Railway production service.

### Completed

- Extracted static-path decoding and resolution into a testable server helper.
- Malformed percent-encoded paths now return HTTP 400 with `MALFORMED_PATH` instead of throwing an uncaught exception.
- Added focused regression coverage for malformed encoding, encoded filenames, SPA fallback, and traversal attempts.
- Replaced the hard-coded production Preview URL in CI with discovery of a successful GitHub deployment for the exact PR head.
- CI rejects the permanent production URL, any deployment reporting `environment: production`, a branch mismatch, or a commit mismatch.
- CI verifies `/health`, `/version`, and the deployed malformed-path response against the isolated Preview.

### Validation

- Focused local `node --test`: 2 server-path tests passed.
- Local `node --check server.js`: passed.
- Full `npm run check` and isolated Railway Preview evidence remain required from GitHub CI for the final branch head.
- Railway PR Environments must be enabled in the Railway project; CI now fails with an explicit configuration message rather than testing production when none is available.

### Next best task

Run independent QA against the isolated Railway PR Environment for Pull Request #1 and merge only after its `/version` matches the reviewed head.

## 2026-07-18 — Release safety acknowledgement enforced

**Outcome:** Prevent creator onboarding from launching when the required fictional-world safety acknowledgement is unchecked.

### Completed

- Added a capture-phase onboarding safety gate that blocks the launch action when the acknowledgement is not selected.
- Added synchronized English and Arabic validation messages.
- Added keyboard focus recovery plus `aria-invalid`, `aria-describedby`, and assertive live feedback for the blocked state.
- Added dependency-free Node tests for acknowledgement validation and localized error selection.
- Updated `npm run check` to execute the test suite before the production build.

### Validation

- `node --test`: 2 tests passed.
- `node --check src/safety-gate.js`: passed.
- Railway Preview URL, `/health`, `/version`, mobile, keyboard, RTL/LTR, and integration-state evidence remain release-review gates for the final PR head.

### Next best task

Complete QA release verification for Pull Request #1 without expanding the current scope.

## 2026-07-18 — Autonomous delivery protocol applied

**Outcome:** Make the five scheduled agents operate through one recoverable GitHub workflow without approval waits, duplicate cycles, hidden CI failures, or unverified production releases.

### Completed

- Replaced `AGENT.md` with the authoritative autonomous contract.
- Established GitHub Issues and labels as the only workflow state.
- Enforced one `auto:active` issue and the `stage:ux → stage:safety → stage:build → stage:release` pipeline.
- Defined role ownership, task-size limits, CI classification, three-attempt repair limit, three-hour recovery, six-hour cycle escape, and external-blocker fallbacks.
- Added `AUTONOMOUS_DELIVERY.md` with the label catalog, issue contract, CI decision tree, release evidence, production incident handling, and recovery timers.
- Strengthened the Pull Request template with task keys, changed-file reasons, multilingual and safety gates, Preview evidence, rollback, and post-merge completion checks.
- Added `.github/workflows/production-smoke.yml` to verify Railway production `/health` and ensure `/version` matches each commit pushed to `main`.

### Remaining repository settings

- Create the documented workflow labels in GitHub if they do not already exist.
- Protect `main` and require CI plus Production Smoke where repository settings allow it.
- Keep the Railway production service linked to `main` after the foundation Pull Request is merged.

### Next best task

Resolve and merge the current foundation Pull Request, verify Railway deploys the merged `main` commit, then let Product Lead create the first labeled autonomous cycle.

## 2026-07-18 — Repository prepared for focused agents

**Outcome:** Make the repository directly usable by a small five-agent team with one-task cycles, Railway Preview review, and no conflicting implementations.

### Completed
- Reduced normal development to Product Lead, Game and UX, Safety and Fairness, Full-Stack Engineer, and QA and Release.
- Updated `AGENT.md` with the fixed team, one-code-owner rule, branch policy, Railway Preview requirement, and stop conditions.
- Updated the orchestrator prompt to prohibit extra agents and automatic merging.
- Added `.github/pull_request_template.md` with acceptance, safety, localization, social-integration, CI, Railway evidence, rollback, and post-merge completion checks.
- Added `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/agent-cycle.yml` so one issue defines one measurable development cycle.
- Added `AGENT_QUICKSTART.md` with the exact command to start an agent cycle and the repository-owner review checklist.

### Operating rule

One issue → one branch → one implementation owner → one Pull Request → one Railway Preview → owner review → stop.

### Validation

- Agent instructions require official APIs, public oEmbed, or OAuth for social integrations.
- User-visible work requires Railway Preview and `/version` verification.
- Agents cannot merge, change production secrets, or begin a second task.

### Next best task

Validate the current multilingual social post and YouTube profile import on Railway, record results in the Pull Request, and fix only confirmed defects.

## 2026-07-18 — Social content, creator profiles, and multilingual UI

**Outcome:** Let creators bring public social content and profile identity into Creatorverse while supporting Arabic and English safely.

### Completed

- Added public post preview for YouTube, TikTok, and X through allowlisted official oEmbed endpoints.
- Added a server-side URL allowlist, HTTPS-only validation, request size limit, and upstream timeout.
- Added YouTube creator profile lookup through the official YouTube Data API.
- Added public profile identity, avatar, description, subscribers, videos, and views when publicly available.
- Added a direct path from imported YouTube profile data into creator realm onboarding.
- Added Arabic and English interface support with persisted language choice and automatic RTL/LTR direction.
- Added localized social import and creator profile screens.
- Kept imported data transient in the current prototype; no social credentials, private messages, or follower lists are collected.

### Railway requirement

- Add `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` to Railway Variables to enable YouTube profile lookup.
- Public post previews require no stored social credentials.
- TikTok, X, and Instagram profile data remain deferred to official creator-authorized OAuth connections.

### Validation

- Profile and post requests are sent only from the Railway server, not directly from the browser to arbitrary hosts.
